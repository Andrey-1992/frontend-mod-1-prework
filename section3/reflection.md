## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* This interview make a lot of emphasis in knowing yourself, because this skills will lead me to know how  to act in a struggling situation. Be clear in what is the problems and how do I am gonna solve are skills that I have been work on it since a long time. However, many of these approaches and tips are new for me, but they will help me to have more tools and structure to keep working on my projects.
* Sometime I'm a negative person that used to focus on what is wrong or missing, but the point of *take time and realize about the good things and how far I have come* are a very strong resource to incorporate in my life, specially if I'm comparing myself with high standards.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* Since I started with this course, problems solving has become my main new challenge, at the begging looks very intimidating, but when I started to work on it, then they start to become exciting and challenging, and what they say about programmers is true: "*Without problems, there is not work to be done*" so I demonstrate to myself that I'm working in this mindset.
*  Be more consistent and organize in my work, is something that is missing, because I need to structure a solution and create a plan when something is going wrong. Is crucial to maintain a good balance between work and personal growth.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
In a travel airline's website, because they need to storage all their destinations in a container. When I'm looking for a fly, the destinations are safe in an array, and if I write my destination it will compare with the array info to determinate if they have that destination.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
When we have this Array or *collection* of things, we can indicate certain task to be perform through a method. Base on what we have storage in our Array's container, we can modify or manipulate the information in the required way.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop can probably used as a security measure or a way to speed up our work flow. When we incorporate *array* with *loops* is a good option to call our storage data and be incorporate or selected in determinate situations.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is like a *car race*, the cars are running over and over until they achieve the run required numbers of laps to win. When we have a loop in our computer, we are going to set a number of conditions and parameters to the race, and the computer will run it for us.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
About loops, what are the difference between the other to types of loops *while* and  *do while* ? When should be run every one ?
About Arrays the MDN documentation is so long, does it applies to other things or just in this case to an arrays ?
