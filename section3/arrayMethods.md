## Array Methods

# Method: pop()
With this method take away the last value inside of an array list and keep it safe inside on this method. When we run it with our array it would disappear from our items in the array, but we can have easily access when we called this method pop(). Another very important point to have in mind is: This method will only apply when we have elements in out array and length parameter, otherwise the return value will be *undefined* (zero-based language). Besides, this method will affect the length parameter in the array decrementing the length.

# Method: shift()
This method work and applied the same rules as the *pop()* method, but it's applied to the first value in an array (*opposite value than pop()*). You can use both of this values many times as you want until your array is empty. A special characteristic is the *shift()* method is often used in a condition inside while loop. When we *remove* an item using shift method is important to have in mind that our __"0"__ will change the number of the other index. 

# Method: unshift()
This method works contrary to the previous methods (*pop() and shift()*), because this method add value to an array an increase the length on it. The new values will be inserted at the begging in the array and it can be applied to an arrays that do not contain length  property. When we *add* an item using shift method is important to have in mind that our __"0"__ will change the number of the other index.

# Method: push
As we can deduct, *shift + and unshift -* work together, while *pop() and push()* will work together. This method will add elements in the end of an array. __1__ sign to keep adding elements, __N__ to indicate that is our last element to add in the array. Also can add multiple arrays into a single value !
