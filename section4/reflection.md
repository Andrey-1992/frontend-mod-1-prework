## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It was an incredible change into my workflow, in few words I felt much more __control__ over my *time and decisions*. I saw a big difference because the last section (section 3) was the most stressful and demanding, I got stuck in many exercises, got confuse on readings and concepts, spent a lot of time fixing problems and losing my time and focus of my work flow.Before start this section I spent some time creating a diagram and check list for this section assigning time and blocks to each section, this technique really help me to maintain focused, organize my time and have an a objective problem's list. At the end of the section I felt more productive and less tired.  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
Something very magical from the *Pomodoro Technique* is how the time managing and breaks made a great difference in my workflow. It allow me to have more control and take better decisions in this section. This technique also helped me to have a cleaner panorama of my situation in order to make a plan or strategy to achieve my goals.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object can be define as a example from a thing, helping us to be more descreptive and authentic. For instance, is not the sema "*I like the forester trucks*" than "*I like the Aaron's forester*". In my opinion the difference between *Arrays* and *Objects* is that objects allow us to have more control and organization to manipulate our database.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: __Array,__ because it does not have to be selected and classified.
  * List of states and their capitals: __Object,__ because with an objects we can select and organize our data in specific ways.
  * List of things to pack for vacation: __Array,__ is just a list that we can easily add or remove things on it.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: __Array,__ because is a list and is ordered by patron of numbers.
  * List of student names and their cohort: __Object,__ because we have to select and administrate data with certain conditions.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: __Object,__because we need to structure our ingredients and amount.
  * All my favorite restaurants: __Array,__ is just like to make a list in my notebook, and we can assign it with numbers.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
Probably in amazon app or website, because is a process since we start to look for an item , add to the cart and finally purchase it,  the app has to administrate and create a tickets and assumptions for us, updating our status until we got the  item with us.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I believe there is a tiny line between them and sometimes I can easily to get confuses with them, because depends of each situation and how to use it. But mostly i feel this is like a box inside of other box and I don't know if maybe this becomes harder to understand it or is another easy way to complete my job.
