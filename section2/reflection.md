## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I feel I spent too long to ask, I realized two important things about it:
* I prefer not ask a question because I don't want to be *judge* as a less able or skilled than in my class.
* Is true that is a new and hard skill to develop, but __I'm not the only one in this situation.__

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
At the begging was so hard and stressfully, but I review section 1 and make my own notes to run it. I still have some doubts and question when I'm using node, but so far I can run my code right.  

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
* When we want to make a decision is useful to have a conditional statement. This will let us to establish parameters and conditions to support our decision.
* Probably today before to drive to my work, I should establish a list of conditionals statement to verify is  my *car's conditions* (parameters) are appropriate to do it.
* When we try to log in in a website, the conditional states to do it, is that our email and password must match in the website portal.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
`if` is a condition that we assign to our program, to execute and interact with thew user. For example, is we are applying for a credit card, we can program our code with different values to give different options. First case, "`if` the user has less  or equal to *99 K* in the account, offers __A-credit__", Second case, "`if else` the user has more or equal than *45 K* in the account, offers __B-credit__" last case," `else` the user has equal than *40 K* in the account, offers __c-credit__".

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
__Logical Operators__ are crucial for these circumstances, divided in two categories : _AND = &&_ and _OR = ||__
* AND = && : This logical applies when we require __both__ conditions are *true*
* OR = || : This logical applies when we require __both__ or _only one__ condition is *true*.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I think I understood the concepts and how they works, but the fact of understanding how apply them in a website is very abstract and hard to imagine.
