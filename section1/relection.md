## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
* __Number:__ In this data type we have to assign everything related with numbers, such as :
- Positive and negative numbers, decimals.
- We can start from one digit and incorporate many digits as we need it.
- Besides, in this data type we can do comparison operators and mathematical operations using :
<, >, ==, !=, +, -, *, /, %,  and more operations commands.
* __String:__ This data type is used to represent ideas, phrases, texts, concepts incorporating *alphabet characters*, *special characters*, *spaces* and even *Numbers*. But __Always__ wrapped within quotes.
* __Boolean:__ This data type works with only two characters *true* and *false*. It can be very helpful when we need confirm an answer within the program or an input.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
* First create a variable: *var phrase =*
* Assign the `"Hello World!"` as a __variable value__ into our variable: *var phrase = `"Hello World!"`*
* Write down our variable into our console and run it: console.log(`"Hello World!"`); // Must print `"Hello World!"`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
* Comments are used to explain what our code does it and also becomes helpful to read and understand it for us and others developers who requires work with our code.
__Multi-Line Comments:__
- Starts with __/*__ and finish with __*/__ , filling the space between them, with our code.
- Is mostly used for a long comments and describe how the *script* works.
__Single-Line Comments:__
- Starts with  *//* and we add our comments after that.
- They are really helpful to describe our code or add some explicit message.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* A variable is a magic keyword that allow us to storage information in our program. There are some rules to make magic with this word. Firstly, __var__ would be our *abracadabra*, secondly we need to give a special name to *remember* it, and finally we have put our *magic word* inside of our __magic hat.__

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
* Probably when I add an item into my *Cart* while I'm shopping. The assign variable with *number* data type can starts in "0" but while I'm adding items in it, it would increase or also decrease base on my interaction with that variable.
* Another possible *variable* is when I sign in into a website, this action will ask to the browser if my account and password match with their data base, using the *boolean* data type for this task.
* Another possible situation is when I select one item and it has the possibility to change different colors or styles, I believe in this particular case the *variable* works with *string* and it varies based in out interaction with it.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
* Is an easy and fast way to get together different ideas or variables (*does not matter what data type we use*) in a single line, creating and presenting a __unified blend__ conformed by different sources.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
* While we are customizing our account or maybe creating a personal item.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
* During the exercise everything has been so clear and precise and I think a really understand the concepts of every part from this section. But I really don't understand __Where?__, __When?__ and __How?__ implement in a website.
* Are variables only used to report a error mensagge in our website or *How? and Why?* they are important in our website.
